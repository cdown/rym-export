I have a bunch of data on Rate Your Music. This was ok in the past as they provided an export function -- unfortunately as of recent this button is entirely gone.

This script will get all of your rated albums and output them as a single JSON object. Please note that scraping is against their terms of service, but using it for the purpose of getting your own data out again is hardly a sin. If RYM was based on Europe, they would be required to do this under European data rights law. The script even has a sleep between scraping pages to be respectful to RYM's resources.
